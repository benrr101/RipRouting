Benjamin Russell (brr1922)

Input Format -
Input is via the file "network" in the same folder as the running java files.
The file must contain (in this order):
- A line SUBNETMASK:{IP ADDRESS}
- A line ROUTERS-- to denote where routers begin
- Multiple lines of {IP ADDRESS} to define the list of routers
- A line CONNECTIONS-- to denote where routers are finished and connections begin
- Multiple lines of {IP ADDRESS} {IP ADDRESS} {LINK COST} to define the connection
Note: {IP ADDRESS} corresponds to a valid IP address. {LINK COST} corresponds
to a positive integer.

Output -
Output may be taken from straight from the command line via
output redirection.

Turning off dynamic connections -
By default connections will fail at a fairly high rate. To turn this off,
specify the command line option "--no-dynamics" to turn it off.
